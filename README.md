This is the main repository for the BioCADDIE Harvester project: 

Goals:

This project explores the use of social coding sites such as GitHub to
enable decentralized dataset description and data sharing. We will
develop tools around a lightweight metadata format that can be easily
embedded into existing or new project repositories, and easily indexed
as part of both the web of linked data and the BioCADDIE project.
