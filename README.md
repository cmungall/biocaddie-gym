This is the main repository for the BioCADDIE Harvester project

__NOTE__: the start date of the project has been delayed, expect to
see more action here the beginning of 2016! The GitHub tickets will be
adjusted accordingly.

# Description

This project will explore the use of social coding sites such as
GitHub for publishing and sharing descriptions of datasets. We will
develop create a format aligned with the Health Care and Life Sciences
(HCLS) Dataset Description profile that can be easily embedded in a
project repository, and foster a lightweight tool ecosystem around
this. This includes dynamic publishing of dataset descriptions, and
automatic validation through the Travis continuous integration
system. We will pilot this project by taking existing datasets and
describing them retrospectively, and by working with an existing
project and describing this prospectively. The goal will to ultimately
have this indexed within the biocaddie system.

Progress can be monitored on the project GitHub repository:
github.com/cmungall/biocaddie-gym

(the repo may move to an org, but redirects should work)

# Dataset Providers: we want you!

Do you provide or release data using a distributed VCS site like
github? Are you interested in doing this? Alternatively, are you
interested in using github to provide metadata for data released
elsewhere (e.g. Dryad, FigShare, ...)?

If so, we want to hear from you!
